DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY
================================================================================

1. Baseline Data (Year T):
   - USDA Food Access Atlas (most recent year)
   - Census ACS 5-year estimates (most recent)
   - Current grocery store locations

2. Historical Data (Year T-5 to T-10):
   - Historical Food Access Atlas releases
   - Historical ACS estimates
   - Historical grocery store data (if available)

3. Change Metrics (Delta calculations):
   - Δ Median Income (T-5 to T)
   - Δ Poverty Rate (T-5 to T)
   - Δ Grocery Store Density (T-5 to T)
   - Δ Vehicle Ownership (T-5 to T)
   - Δ Transit Access (T-5 to T)

4. Target Variable:
   - Binary: Did tract become low-access between T-5 and T?
   - Or: Probability of becoming low-access in next 5 years

================================================================================
