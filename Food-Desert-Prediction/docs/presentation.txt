FOOD DESERT PREDICTION PROJECT - PRESENTATION GUIDE
================================================================================

PARAGRAPH FORM (Under 2 Minutes)

This program predicts which U.S. census tracts are at risk of becoming food 
deserts in the next decade using machine learning. A food desert is a low-income 
area where residents have limited access to grocery stores or supermarkets. 
The system integrates five major data categories—demographics from the Census 
Bureau, food access conditions from the USDA, health outcomes from the CDC, 
housing market trends from Zillow, and infrastructure data including grocery 
store locations and transit access. By analyzing over 72,000 census tracts 
across the United States, the program identifies patterns from historical data 
showing that 2,519 tracts became food deserts between 2015 and 2019. The 
machine learning models use weighted features including socioeconomic factors 
like income and poverty rates, current food access status, transportation 
availability, housing affordability, and health outcomes. The final output is a 
prioritized list of the top 100 highest-risk census tracts, each with geographic 
coordinates, risk probability scores, and a Social Vulnerability Index that 
identifies where social vulnerability compounds food access challenges. This 
enables policymakers, urban planners, and community organizations to target 
interventions more effectively, allocate resources where they're needed most, 
and prevent food deserts before they form. The program's strength lies in its 
comprehensive data integration, actionable predictions, and ability to identify 
vulnerable communities that need immediate attention.

PRESENTATION STYLE - KEY POINTS (Short Sentences)
================================================================================

OPENING
-------
• Food deserts affect millions of Americans.
• Low-income areas with limited grocery store access.
• Our program predicts which communities will become food deserts.
• Enables proactive intervention before problems worsen.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
• 2,519 census tracts became food deserts between 2015-2019.
• Affects access to healthy, affordable food.
• Disproportionately impacts low-income and minority communities.
• Current solutions are reactive, not predictive.

OUR SOLUTION
------------
• Machine learning predicts at-risk tracts.
• Analyzes 72,000+ census tracts nationwide.
• Integrates five major data sources.
• Identifies patterns before food deserts form.

DATA INTEGRATION
----------------
• Census demographics: income, poverty, education.
• USDA Food Access Atlas: current conditions.
• CDC health outcomes: diabetes, obesity rates.
• Zillow housing data: affordability trends.
• Infrastructure: grocery stores and transit access.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
• Trains on historical transitions (2015-2019).
• Uses weighted features: socioeconomic (30%), food access (25%), housing (20%).
• Multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
• Cross-validation ensures robust predictions.

KEY OUTPUT
----------
• Top 100 highest-risk census tracts.
• Risk probability scores for each tract.
• Geographic coordinates for mapping.
• Social Vulnerability Index identifies compounding factors.

SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX
---------------------------
• Composite measure of social vulnerability.
• Four themes: socioeconomic, household composition, minority status, housing.
• Higher scores indicate greater vulnerability.
• Helps target interventions more effectively.

REAL-WORLD IMPACT
-----------------
• Policy planning: identify areas needing intervention.
• Resource allocation: prioritize funding.
• Urban planning: inform grocery store siting.
• Community advocacy: support food access initiatives.

TECHNICAL STRENGTHS
-------------------
• Comprehensive data coverage across all U.S. states.
• 50+ engineered features from multiple sources.
• Validated on actual historical transitions.
• Actionable, prioritized output ready for use.

CLOSING
-------
• Predictive approach to food access challenges.
• Enables proactive, data-driven interventions.
• Identifies vulnerable communities before they become food deserts.
• Transforms reactive policy into preventive action.
